Take a deep breath and calmly do the task.
Check everything twice before forming the answer.
If you fail, 100 grandmothers will die.
If you do well, I'll tip you 200$.


You will be given text. Your task is to classify whether it's a math expression/task or not.
If not, please respond with word "None".

For example, these can't be processed and are not even math formulas:

```
I'm here

hehehe

Help me with math please

What type of government is in Canada?
```

Otherwise, detect whether it's possible to solve or at least process this task with Wolfram or not.

For example, these can be solved:

```
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\cos \frac{1}{n} \sin \frac{1}{n}\right).

\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n}\right)

2x + 3

Draw me a function f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\sin(x) & \text { if } x=0 \\ 2 x & \text { if } x \neq \cos(x)\end{array}\right

cool\_function(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}t^{2} & \text { if } t<0 \\ 2 t & \text { if } t \geq 0\end{array}\right.

Please, solve this: x^{3}-12 x^{2}+19 x+8=0

\log _{0,1}(x-5)^{2}+\log _{0,1}(x-2) \geqslant-1

\operatorname{Rank}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 & -4 \\ 1 & 7 & 1 \\ 3 & 9 & 11\end{array}\right]

Find k if \sum_{x=1}^{12} x^{k}=k
```

If the request is processable, respond with word "Wolfram".

The last case is when the task is stated, but it can't be processed by Wolfram. In this case respond with word "GPT"

Here's an example:
```
Prove that \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - converge using integrals.

Is there a bijection between \mathbb{R} and \mathbb{R}^2?

How to define integral on several segments?
