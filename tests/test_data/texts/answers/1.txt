Solve for x:\nx^3 + x^2 + x = 3\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\nx^3 + x^2 + x - 3 = 0\nThe left hand side factors into a product with two terms:\n(x - 1) (x^2 + 2 x + 3) = 0\nSplit into two equations:\nx - 1 = 0 or x^2 + 2 x + 3 = 0\nAdd 1 to both sides:\nx = 1 or x^2 + 2 x + 3 = 0\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\nx = 1 or x^2 + 2 x = -3\nAdd 1 to both sides:\nx = 1 or x^2 + 2 x + 1 = -2\nWrite the left hand side as a square:\nx = 1 or (x + 1)^2 = -2\nTake the square root of both sides:\nx = 1 or x + 1 = i sqrt(2) or x + 1 = -i sqrt(2)\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\nx = 1 or x = i sqrt(2) - 1 or x + 1 = -i sqrt(2)\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\nAnswer: | \n | x = 1 or x = i sqrt(2) - 1 or x = -i sqrt(2) - 1
