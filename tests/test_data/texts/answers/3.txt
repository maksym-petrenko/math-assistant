Solve for x:\n16 x^3 - 18 x^2 + 4 x - 21 = 0\nEliminate the quadratic term by substituting x = x - 3/8:\n-21 + 4 (x + 3/8) - 18 (x + 3/8)^2 + 16 (x + 3/8)^3 = 0\nExpand out terms of the left hand side:\n16 x^3 - (11 x)/4 - 339/16 = 0\nDivide both sides by 16:\nx^3 - (11 x)/64 - 339/256 = 0\nChange coordinates by substituting x = y + λ/y, where λ is a constant value that will be determined later:\n-339/256 - 11/64 (y + λ/y) + (y + λ/y)^3 = 0\nMultiply both sides by y^3 and collect in terms of y:\ny^6 + y^4 (3 λ - 11/64) - (339 y^3)/256 + y^2 (3 λ^2 - (11 λ)/64) + λ^3 = 0\nSubstitute λ = 11/192 and then z = y^3, yielding a quadratic equation in the variable z:\nz^2 - (339 z)/256 + 1331/7077888 = 0\nFind the positive solution to the quadratic equation:\nz = (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))/4608\nSubstitute back for z = y^3:\ny^3 = (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))/4608\nTaking cube roots gives (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3)/(8 3^(2/3)) times the third roots of unity:\ny = (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3)/(8 3^(2/3)) or y = -(-3051 - 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3)/(8 3^(2/3)) or y = ((-1)^(2/3) (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3))/(8 3^(2/3))\nSubstitute each value of y into x = y + 11/(192 y):\nx = (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(1/3)/(8 3^(2/3)) + 11/(8 (3 (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051))^(1/3)) or x = (11 (-1)^(2/3))/(8 (3 (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051))^(1/3)) - (-4 sqrt(581538) - 3051)^(1/3)/(8 3^(2/3)) or x = ((-1)^(2/3) (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(1/3))/(8 3^(2/3)) - 11/8 ((-1)/(3 (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)))^(1/3)\nBring each solution to a common denominator and simplify:\nx = ((4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(2/3) + 11 3^(1/3))/(8 3^(2/3) (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3)) or x = (11 (-3)^(2/3) - (-3)^(1/3) (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(2/3))/(24 (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3)) or x = ((-1)^(2/3) (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(1/3) - 11 ((-3)/(4 sqrt(581538) + 3051))^(1/3))/(8 3^(2/3))\nSubstitute back for x = x + 3/8:\nAnswer: | \n | x = (11 3^(1/3) + (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(2/3))/(8 3^(2/3) (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(1/3)) + 3/8 or x = (11 (-3)^(2/3) - (-3)^(1/3) (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(2/3))/(24 (4 sqrt(581538) + 3051)^(1/3)) + 3/8 or x = ((-1)^(2/3) (3051 + 4 sqrt(581538))^(1/3) - 11 (-3/(3051 + 4 sqrt(581538)))^(1/3))/(8 3^(2/3)) + 3/8
